Can you make it so when a item is dropped onto the rail it also goes moves? :white_check_mark: 

also make it so the belt "keeps going" between the 2 belts when they are placed next to each other. (*The character looks like it stopped when in the middle of two belts for a few moments before getting carded ti the next belt*)
